Cr√©ation d'un mini jeu "Mastermind" lors d'un processus de recrutement

                                                                      Welcome to my 'Mastermind Game'

The goal of the game is to guess, by successive deductions, the color and position of the 5 pieces chosen beforehand by a very advanced artificial intelligence borrowed from NASA.

The pieces can be of 8 colors: 'red', 'yellow', 'blue', 'orange', 'green', 'white', 'purple', 'pink'.

The game is presented in the form of a dialogue box between you and the advanced ia. This one will allow you to give a succession of colors.

There are also several game modes:

- one called 'normal' in which the ia too strong gives you a written and visual summary of your deduction of the previous turn.

- an assisted one in which the invincible ia gives a more detailed summary.

- and a cheat mode which allows you to see directly the color sequence chosen by the unbeatable ia.


!!! Good luck and have fun !!!
